# Machine Learning AI

There are many games out there with players wanted to increase their skill levels, but without many resources. SuperSmash Bros. has created a way to do just that.

## SuperSmashBros Machine Learning AI

- The point of the "character" you can implement in the game is to teach it your moves and eventually figure out how you can defeat yourself. It learns at a very fast rate and as it levels, it will increase it's reaction time.
- This character will push the player to be faster and try new things in-game.

### MIT Creates Unbeatable AI
- A team at MIT created an AI that not only kept up with the worlds top Smash players, but beat them.
- With an average reaction time of 33 milliseconds, (6 times faster than a human) it is no wonder why this AI machine could dominate pro-play.

#### Conclusion
While I don't think that Pro-Gaming will ever be completely machine-only, the possibilites are endless for AI systems like the one described above. A recent released game called "Elden Ring" has been given the honor of being one of the most difficult games released of all time. Imagine if this technology was used to further the skill of bosses, thus demanding more critical thinking to beat the game.
